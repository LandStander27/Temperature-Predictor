## Temperature Predictor
- Predicts temps for a specific date, along with rain
- Tested on Windows but probably works on Linux as well (can't use builtin make script)

#### Installing
- Download and run compiled binary from releases tab
#### Building from source (recommended)
- Install [VLang](https://vlang.io) and add to `PATH`
- Download GCC from [here](https://winlibs.com/) and add bin to `PATH`
- Clone repo using `git clone https://github.com/LandStander27/Temperature-Predictor.git`
- Run `make.bat` (or if you are using my custom made terminal, [VTerminal](https://gitlab.com/Land23/vterminal), run `make.vterm`)
- Compiled binary will be in `.\bin\predictor.exe`
